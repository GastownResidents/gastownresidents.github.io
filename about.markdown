## [Resident's Advocacy Group] Vision Statement

“We envision a positive future based on a safe and vibrant community where all residents feel welcome, respected, and supported.”

Our vision is to create a safe and vibrant community where all residents feel welcome, respected, and supported. We will work to achieve this vision by:
- Advocating for policies and programs that promote safety and well-being
- Building relationships between residents, neighbouring community organizations and BIAs
- Providing opportunities for residents, owners and ratepayers to get involved and make a positive impact.

We believe that a safe community is essential for the health and well-being of all residents. We are committed to working with all stakeholders to make our vision a reality.

Here are some specific examples of how [Resident's Advocacy Group] can work to achieve this vision:
- Work with law enforcement to develop and implement crime prevention strategies
- Advocate for increased funding for public safety programs
- Organize community events to build relationships and foster a sense of community
- Provide access to resources and support to residents who are victims of crime or violence

By working together, we can create a safe and vibrant community where everyone thrives.
